# Intro
I'm a second year MURP in the transporation policy and planning concentration. I get excited about transportation because of it's ability to connect people to the things they need, joy, and the people and places around them. I worked at a community design center in Philadelphia and in bike advocacy in Baltimore, and am currently working with the Vision Zero team at LADOT. 

# Course Description
Designed to familiarize students with use of geographic data in public policy, urban planning, and related practice, and develop skill base for community practice that provides each student with tools necessary to organize and plan effectively for political, economic, and social justice in our communities. Students learn how to use geographic information systems (GIS) to inform practice, advocacy, and policy work. 
# Project Ideas
* Potentially something related to this national study [*United States fatal pedestrian crash hot spot locations and characteristics*](https://jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/1825), potentially doing a similar study just within LA. 
* Also very curious about doing something related to mapping infrastructure funding, a la this article [LAâ€™s Annual $1 Billion Gamble: Spending without a Plan
](https://investinginplace.org/2021/09/28/las-annual-1-billion-gamble-spending-without-a-plan/), but not sure how readily available that data let alone that data by geographic location is.
